To combine the salinity data and district boundaries, the "Combine_shapefiles.ipynb" file can be run. This file takes as input Salinity_raster_data.tif and "Districts_Mekong_delta.shp". The outputs of this file are: "districts_salinity.gpkg" for the districts combined with salinity, and "district_boundaries.gpkg" for the district boundaries. 

The correct data per district can be collected by running the "Complete data analysis for districts" file. However, datasets of VHLSS and Pop Housing Census are requird, which are not published on github
