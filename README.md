This model simulates the inhabitants of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Model version3 shows the newest version of the ABM. It is therefore recommended to download the map "model_version3".  
The model uses data from the pop housing census 2009,2019 and VHLSS2014. The input data for a certain district can be found in the "Data" folder in Model_Version3. 
To run the model you need to run model_run3.ipynb. 

The sensitivity analysis can be found in the model_version3 map as well, in the "Sensitivity Analysis" map. 

The Vensim model with the exact same variables as the ABM can be found in "Vensim Files" map, together with a notebook to create the outcome graphs. The datasets are the exported results from the model runs. The second Vensim model (created for Deltares) can also be found here. 

The final report can be found in the documentation map.
