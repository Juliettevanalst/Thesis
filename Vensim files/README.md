The correct SD model with the same variables as the ABM is called "Final SD model VMD.mdl". 
There is a second version, this one does not have the same variables as the ABM, but is created together with Deltares. This model is called "VMD SD model Deltares Version.mdl".

The graphs are created in the Vensim_graphs.ipynb file, and input for these graps are the SD_model_input.xlsx, and SD_sensitivity_input.xlsx.  

The sensitivity analysis is conducted in Vensim, with univariate sensitivity and 100 iterations per variable.
